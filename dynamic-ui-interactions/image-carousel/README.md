# About
As the second and final practice of [Dynamic User Interface Interactions](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-dynamic-user-interface-interactions), this project focuses on creating an image carousel that can be seen on many websites. I decided to approach this by using only my current knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so the finished result might not be as polished or optimized as the ones on the web. This is because that these dynamic UI interactions could supposedly be done with my current knowledge and I felt like that this was a great time to practice my problem solving and planning skills!

## Lessons Learned
While this was a short project, I was able to dabble some more in setTimeouts and CSS positioning. They were the two cornerstones of the project and working on them helped me learn more about the use cases of these tools. Even with a short project like this I had some setbacks and with each setback I've overcame them and became better a programming overall!
